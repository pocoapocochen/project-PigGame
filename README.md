## Game Rules
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
* In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she whishes. 
* Each result get added to his ROUND score.
* BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his/her ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his/her ROUND score gets added to 
  his/her GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
* The first player to reach 50 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.

## User Story
